Not finished


This is a data analysis project about a data set provided by Great Learning and University of Texas at Austin about Real State in Australia, Melbourne , it has 27114 rows and 16 columns. It is not Big Data but it is one of my first aproches to a proper data analysis. 

The approach to the EDA: 
- Sanity check
- Univariate Analysis 
- Bivariate Analysis 
- Missing Value Treatment 
- Outlier Detection and Treatment
- Conclusions
- Causality check
